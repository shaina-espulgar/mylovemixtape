          <img src="heart.png" alt="Hi, pogi. I hope you'll love this gift. 
          I can't afford to buy anything right now so I thought I'd build something
          for you. I know my voice is not that good :< but I'm sure that you'll 
          appreciate my effort. I just want to say that I am very grateful to
          have you, to spend my entire year with you. This year has been a 
          rollercoaster for us, and I know that we're not in a very good place in our
          relationship right now. Always remember that I'm always rooting for you, 
          just like how you supported me all this time. Thank you so much for being
          my support system. Thank you for making me happy. I really love your company.
          Thank you for all the meals that we've shared. Food will always be 10x better
          when we're eating side by side. Thank you for treating me like a princess 
          whenever we go out. I really appreciate how you care for me. Thank you for 
          all the compliments especially at times when I don't feel attractive. Thank you 
          for being the prettiest boy &#9825; May we have a blessed new year. I'm 
          looking forward to spending this new year with you. I'm excited about all the 
          memories that we'll make. Happy Holidays, my love. Mahal kita." class="center" id="myImg">
